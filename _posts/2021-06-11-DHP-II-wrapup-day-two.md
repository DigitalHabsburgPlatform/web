Wrap-up of day two of the ACDH-CH TOOL GALLERY 7.1/Digital Habsburg Platform II "Prosopographical data modeling, Digital Habsburg Platform II" – Hands on part

Following up on [day one](DHP-II-wrapup-day-one) of the [event](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/events/event-series/acdh-ch-tool-gallery-71), a sizable group of prosopography enthusiasts continued the ways and means of making the [Nuns and Monks – Prosopographical Interfaces, NAMPI](https://nampi.icar-us.eu/) and [The Viennese Court. A prosopographical portal, VieCPro](https://viecpro.oeaw.ac.at/) data interoperable in a machine-readable fashion. 

After a short summary of [day one](DHP-II-wrapup-day-one) which lead into an introduction of [core concepts of semantic web technology](https://howto.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/de/resource/posts/prosopographic-modelling-introduction) by Matej Đurčo, the brilliantly prepared [ACDH-CH](https://acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) team guided participants in three breakout sessions aligned with different levels of abstraction: 

- Ontology level
- Vocabulary level
- Instance level

For those three groups that continued to work in an instance of <https://researchspace.org/>, the ACDH-CH team prepared training material that is available through <https://howto.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/de/resources/posts/page/1> and that does not have to be further elaborated on – apart from expressing amazement on both the scope and quality of the material they came up with (big thanks!) 

In the last phase of the event, all teams joined the plenary once again to exchange their experiences with working with researchspace, with [WebVOWL](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html) and with [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) queries.

In the end, participants have been successful in: 

- relating concepts to each other from different domains
- preliminary conceptual or practical data massage (in the hands-on fashion, or at least or *data meditation* [Thomas Wallnig]) in order to 
- think and create *convergent data* (a term once more emphasized by Howard Hotson in the discussion)

**Interoperability is indeed achievable, but it needs some effort and reasoning.** The "Prosopographical data modeling, Digital Habsburg Platform II" event has shown throughout its two half-days that this is not exactly rocket science, but it definitely helps to have some working infrastructure and a team of tech-savvy colleagues willing to share their knowledge (and their knowledge graphs) with `*.*`.

The brilliant howto material made by the ACDH-CH organizing team will be made available through other channels as well, including: 

- DiTAH: https://www.ditah.at/ressourcen/
- Dariah Campus: https://campus.dariah.eu/

Other services that were discussed include: 

- The Data for History Consortium: http://dataforhistory.org/ 
- Vocabs Services: https://vocabs.dariah.eu/en/

Once more, and in all seriousness: If you find the time to go through the training material: You will not regret it.
